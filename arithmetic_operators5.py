#Exercise 5. The program prompts the user their birth year. Assuming a person’s age
#is a non-negative integer not exceeding 120, output the user’s age or the
#words “Incorrect Year”. The sample outputs assume it’s currently the year
#2016. If you are writing this program during any other year, the correct
#answers may differ. Store the value of the current year in a variable

current_year = 2016
Hayks_birth = 1996
Maris_birth = 2008
print(current_year - Hayks_birth)
print(current_year - Maris_birth)
